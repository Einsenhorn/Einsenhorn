Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m [Einsenhorn](https://github.com/Einsenhorn) a French developer who enjoy solving problems, writing code to improve a product or trying something new ðŸ˜€

Iâ€™m interested by the majority of Javascript technologies/frameworks/libraries, NodeJS, ... (not interested by PHP/Ruby/Java .. Sorry! ðŸ˜…).

Iâ€™m currently learning Go during my free time.

If you want to talk, you can reach out to me on Linkedin, here's my profile: https://www.linkedin.com/in/louis-de-courcel/; I'm currently #opentowork.

Have a good day!
